# SWRPG CLI

Project for me, a person who wanted to build something moderately complex in python.

### Running it

- You should have Python3 and pip installed on your machine.
- Start up a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the program: `python entry.py`

## Dice Roller

Star Wars RPG has a fairly unique dice system:

The CLI dice roller allows you to input the number and type of dice you'd like to use. For example, a roll with two Ability dice, one Proficiency die, two Challenge dice, and one Boost die would be formatted as `2a 1p 2c 1b`.
